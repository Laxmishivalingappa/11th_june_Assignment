    "1 What is a lambda function in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function that can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by a list of arguments (if any) separated by commas, a colon :, and the expression to be evaluated. The result of the expression is automatically returned by the lambda function. Lambda functions are also known as \"anonymous\" functions because they don't have a name like regular functions defined using the def keyword.\n",

    "Now, let's discuss the differences between a lambda function and a regular function in Python:\n",

    "Definition Syntax:\n",
    "Lambda Function: Defined using the lambda keyword, followed by a list of arguments and a single expression.\n",
    "Regular Function: Defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters (if any), a colon :, and the function body consisting of multiple statements (if needed).\n",
    "Name:\n",
    "Lambda Function: Anonymous, meaning they don't have a name. They are typically used for short tasks or where the function is used immediately and not assigned to a variable.\n",
    "Regular Function: Has a name that is used to call the function and can be reused throughout the code.\n",
    "Function Body:\n",
    "Lambda Function: Can only have a single expression, and the result of that expression is returned automatically.\n",
    "Regular Function: Can contain multiple statements, which are executed sequentially. The function can have multiple return statements or no return statement at all, depending on its design.\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "Lambda Function: Ideal for short, one-liner functions that are used for a specific purpose and don't require the complexity of a full-fledged regular function.\n",
    "Regular Function: Suitable for more complex tasks and when the function needs to be used in multiple places throughout the code.\n",

    "4 What are the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in\n",
    "Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    Lambda functions in Python offer several advantages and limitations compared to regular functions defined using the def keyword. Let's explore these aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conciseness: Lambda functions allow you to define small, one-liner functions in a compact and concise manner. They are particularly useful for simple tasks that don't require a large function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Need for Naming: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't require a name. This eliminates the need to come up with names for small, short-lived functions that are only used in specific places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms, where functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments to other functions, making it easier to write higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: In certain cases, using a lambda function directly in a higher-order function (e.g., map(), filter(), sorted()) can improve code readability by avoiding the need to define a separate named function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Expression: Lambda functions can only consist of a single expression. This means they cannot contain multiple statements, loops, or complex logic, limiting their utility for more complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Documentation: Lambda functions lack the ability to add docstrings (documentation strings) for explaining the function's purpose, making them less suitable for codebases that require extensive documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Readability: While lambda functions can improve readability in certain scenarios, they can also reduce code readability when used for complex or non-trivial operations. Named functions defined with def often provide better readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Default Arguments: Unlike regular functions, lambda functions cannot have default arguments. This means you must provide values for all the arguments when using a lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Debugging: Lambda functions do not have descriptive names, so when an error occurs, debugging can be more challenging since the error message will reference the lambda function's memory address rather than a meaningful name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Reusability: Due to their anonymous nature, lambda functions are not reusable in other parts of the code, unlike regular functions, which can be called from multiple places.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lambda functions in Python are suitable for quick and short tasks where conciseness and brevity are valued. They are commonly used in functional programming and certain higher-order functions. However, for more complex tasks, code readability, maintainability, and reusability, regular functions defined with def are preferred, as they offer more flexibility and better support for documentation and debugging. It's essential to choose the appropriate tool (lambda functions or regular functions) based on the specific requirements and complexity of the task at hand."
